        <h2>Scarcity and Economics</h2>
        <p>
          The management of society’s resources is important because resources
          are scarce.
          <b
            >Scarcity means that society has limited resources and therefore
            cannot produce all the goods and services people wish to have.</b
          >
          Just as each member of a household cannot get everything she wants,
          each individual in a society cannot attain the highest standard of
          living to which she might aspire.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >Economics is the study of how society manages its scarce
            resourcess.</b
          >
          In most societies, resources are allocated not by an all-powerful
          dictator but through the combined choices of millions of households
          and firms.
        </p>

        <h2>1. How People Make Decisions:</h2>
        <h3>Principle 1: People Face With Trade-offs</h3>
        <p>
          You may have heard the old saying, “There ain’t no such thing as a
          free lunch.” Grammar aside, there is much truth to this adage. To get
          something that we like, we usually have to give up something else that
          we also like. Making decisions requires trading off one goal against
          another.
        </p>
        <figure class="non-mg">
          <img src="../../img/blog/ECO/blog1/2.png" alt="Thành phần máy tính" />
          <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          To conclude, principle 1 is about getting something that we like, we
          have to give up something else that we also like. Consider a student
          who must decide how to allocate her most valuable resource—her time.
          She can spend all of her time studying economics, spend all of it
          studying psychology, or divide it between the two fields. For every
          hour she studies one subject, she gives up an hour she could have used
          studying the other. And for every hour she spends studying, she gives
          up an hour she could have spent napping, bike riding, watching TV, or
          working at her part-time job for some extra spending money.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Principle 2: The Cost of Something Is What You Give Up to Get It
        </h3>

        <p>
          Because people face trade-offs, making decisions requires comparing
          the costs and benefits of alternative courses of action. In many
          cases, however, the cost of an action is not as obvious as it might
          first appear.
        </p>

          <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          <b>
            The opportunity cost of an item is what you give up to get that
            item.</b
          >
          When making any decision, decision makers should be aware of the
          opportunity costs that accompany each possible action.
        </p>
        <p>
          The opportunity cost of an item is what you give up to get that item.
        </p>
        <h3>Principle 3: Rational People Think at the Margin:</h3>
        <p>
          Economists normally assume that people are rational.
          <b> Rational people</b>
          systematically and purposefully do the best they can to achieve their
          objectives, given the available opportunities
        </p>
        <figure class="non-mg">
          <img src="../../img/blog/ECO/blog1/4.png" alt="Thành phần máy tính" />
          <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Economists use the term <b>marginal change</b> to describe a small
          incremental adjustment to an existing plan of action. Keep in mind
          that margin means “edge,” so
          <b>
            marginal changes are adjustments around the edges of what you are
            doing.</b
          >
          Rational people often make decisions by comparing marginal benefits
          and marginal costs.
        </p>
        <p>
          marginal changes are adjustments around the edges of what you are
          doing.
        </p>
        <h3>Principle 4: People Respond to Incentives</h3>
        <p>
          <b
            >An incentive is something (such as the prospect of a punishment or
            reward) that induces a person to act. </b
          >Because rational people make decisions by comparing costs and
          benefits, they respond to incentives. You will see that incentives
          play a central role in the study of economics. Incentives are key to
          analyzing how markets work. For example, when the price of an apple
          rises, people decide to eat fewer apples. At the same time, apple
          orchards
        </p>
        <figure class="non-mg">
          <img src="../../img/blog/ECO/blog1/5.png" alt="Thành phần máy tính" />
          <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="non-mg">
          decide to hire more workers and harvest more apples. In other words, a
          higher price in a market provides an incentive for buyers to consume
          less and an incentive for sellers to produce more.
