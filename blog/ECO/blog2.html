          <b>Principle 5: Trade Can Make Everyone Better Off</b>
          <li>People benefit from trade:</li>
          <li class="non-ls">
            - People can buy a greater variety of goods and services at lower
            cost.
          </li>
          <li>Countries benefit from trade:</li>
          <li class="non-ls">
            - Allows countries to specialize in what they do best
          </li>
          <li class="non-ls">
            - Enjoy a greater variety of goods and services
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          You may have heard on the news that the Chinese are our competitors in
          the world economy. In some ways, this is true because American and
          Chinese firms produce many of the same goods. Companies in the United
          States and China compete for the same customers in the markets for
          clothing, toys, solar panels, automobile tires, and many other items.
          Yet it is easy to be misled when thinking about competition among
          countries. Trade between the United States and China is not like a
          sports contest in which one side wins and the other side loses. In
          fact, the opposite is true: Trade between two countries can make each
          country better off.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Principle 6: Markets Are Usually a Good Way to Organize Economic
          Activity
        </h3>

        <p>
          Most countries that once had centrally planned economies have
          abandoned the system and are instead developing market economies. In a
          <b> market economy</b>, the decisions of a central planner are
          replaced by the decisions of millions of firms and households. Firms
          decide whom to hire and what to make. Households decide which firms to
          work for and what to buy with their incomes. These firms and
          households interact in the marketplace, where prices and self-interest
          guide their decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Economist Adam Smith made the most famous observation in all of
          economics: Households and firms interacting in markets act as if they
          are guided by an “invisible hand” that leads them to desirable market
          outcomes.
        </p>

        <p>
          When a government prevents prices from adjusting naturally to supply
          and demand, it impedes the invisible hand’s ability to coordinate the
          decisions of the households and firms that make up an economy.

          <figcaption>Adam Smith’s invisible hand</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h3>Principle 7: Governments Can Sometimes Improve Market Outcomes:</h3>
        <p>
          One reason we need a government is that the invisible hand can work
          its magic only if the government enforces the rules and maintains the
          institutions that are key to a market economy. Most importantly,
          market economies need institutions to enforce property rights so
          individuals can own and control scarce resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another reason we need a government is that, although the invisible
          hand is powerful, it is not omnipotent. There are two broad rationales
          for a government to intervene in the economy and change the allocation
          of resources that people would choose on their own: to promote
          efficiency or to promote equality. That is, most policies aim either
          to enlarge the economic pie or to change how the pie is divided.
        </p>
        <figure class="non-mg">
          <img src="../../img/blog/ECO/blog2/3.png" alt="Thành phần máy tính" />
          <figcaption></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          To say that the government can improve on market outcomes does not
          mean that it always will. Public policy is made not by angels but by a
          political process that is far from perfect. Sometimes policies are
          designed simply to reward the politically powerful. Sometimes they are
          made by well-intentioned leaders who are not fully informed. As you
          study economics, you will become a better judge of when a government
          policy is justifiable because it promotes efficiency or equality and
          when it is not.
        </p>
        <h2>3. How the Economy as a Whole Works</h2>
        <h3>
          Principle 8: A Country’s Standard of Living Depends on Its Ability to
          Produce Goods and Services:
        </h3>
        <p>
          Almost all variation in living standards is attributable to
          differences in countries’ productivity—that is, the amount of goods
          and services produced by each unit of labor input. In nations where
          workers can produce a large quantity of goods and services per hour,
          most people enjoy a high standard of living; in nations where workers
          are less productive, most people endure a more meager existence.
          Similarly, the growth rate of a nation’s productivity determines the
          growth rate of its average income.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fundamental relationship between productivity and living standards
          is simple, but its implications are far-reaching. If productivity is
          the primary determinant of living standards, other explanations must
          be of secondary importance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The relationship between productivity and living standards also has
          profound implications for public policy. When thinking about how any
          policy will affect living standards, the key question is how it will
          affect our ability to produce goods and services. To boost living
          standards, policymakers need to raise productivity by ensuring that
          workers are well educated, have the tools they need to produce goods
          and services, and have access to the best available technology.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Principle 9: Prices Rise When the Government Prints Too Much Money:
        </h3>
        <p>
          This episode is one of history’s most spectacular examples of
          inflation, an increase in the overall level of prices in the economy.
          <b>What causes inflation? </b> In almost all cases of large or
          persistent inflation, the culprit is growth in the quantity of money.
          When a government creates large quantities of the nation’s money, the
          value of the money falls. In Germany in the early 1920s, when prices
          were on average tripling every month, the quantity of money was also
          tripling every month. Although less dramatic, the economic history of
          the United States points to a similar conclusion: The high inflation
          of the 1970s was associated with rapid growth in the quantity of
          money, and the return of low inflation in the 1980s was associated
          with slower growth in the quantity of money.

        <h3>
          Principle 10: Society Faces a Short-Run Trade-off between Inflation
          and Unemployment
        </h3>
        <ul class="non-mg">
          Although a higher level of prices is, in the long run, the primary
          effect of increasing the quantity of money, the short-run story is
          more complex and controversial. Most economists describe the short-run
          effects of monetary injections as follows:
          <li class="non-ls">
            - Increasing the amount of money in the economy stimulates the
            overall level of spending and thus the demand for goods and
            services.
          </li>
          <li class="non-ls">
            - Higher demand may over time cause firms to raise their prices, but
            in the meantime, it also encourages them to hire more workers and
            produce a larger quantity of goods and services.
          </li>
          <li class="non-ls">- More hiring means lower unemployment.</li>
