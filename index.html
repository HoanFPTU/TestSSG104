              Despite the impacts from the complicated world economic and
              political situation, the Vietnamese labor market in 2022 still
              recorded a strong recovery. Supporting and promoting policies from
              the State play an important role in helping the labor-job market
              recover after the Covid-19 pandemic.

        <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 24px">
          Firstly, the labor market has not kept pace with the requirements of
          socio-economic development, has not yet fully adapted to the economic
          restructuring and the process of industrialization, modernization,
          digital transformation and international integration.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 24px">
          Second, the institution of labor market development is still
          inadequate; there are no adequate mechanisms and policies on
          employment transactions, market quality management, regulations on
          labor standards and labor relations.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 24px">
          Thirdly, the labor supply-demand balance is not very effective and
          sustainable, leading to not approaching potential productivity (lack
          of local labor surplus, working in the wrong field of training, etc.).
          The market information system is not really complete. The connection
          between the domestic and international labor markets is still weak.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 24px">
          Fourth, the social safety net has low coverage, has not yet achieved
          high efficiency, and has only played the role of a support for part of
          the labor market.

          In the fourth quarter of 2022, when the world economy and politics
          continued to develop complicatedly, causing the risk of global
          recession, Vietnam could not avoid negative impacts.

          In that context, the underemployment rate of workers in the fourth
          quarter of 2022 was 1.98%, an increase of 0.06 percentage points

          Entering 2023, economic forecasts of all countries are somewhat
          pessimistic. Inflation is expected to weaken but has not yet fallen to
          the previous long-term average level as well as the market's
          expectation. Along with that, major central banks in the world such as
          the FED and the ECB continue to confirm that they will still pursue a
          tight monetary policy in 2023.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 24px">
          The biggest challenge to the market is that the ability of workers to
          change careers is still weak when the labor market information is
          still fragmentary and the skills and qualifications have not yet met
          the change of the employment structure.

        </h2>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 24px">
          Although the recovery rate slowed down in the last months of the year
          due to the impact of the global crisis and the adjustments of the
          domestic market, it must be frankly stated that 2022 is still the year
          of recovery. impression of Vietnam's labor-employment market compared
          to 2021 and compared to the time before the epidemic in 2019. This

          If relevant authorities are determined to accompany workers and
